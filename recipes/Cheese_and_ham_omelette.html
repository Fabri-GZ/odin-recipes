        <h2>Ingredients (1 Serving)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 Free-range eggs</li>
                <li>30g/1oz Cheddar</li>
                <li>1 Thick slice ham, finely chopped </li>
                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper </li>  
            </ul>
        
        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gently beat the eggs together in a mixing bowl and season, to taste, with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a frying pan until foaming. Pour in the eggs and cook for a few seconds, <br>until the bottom of the omelette is lightly set. Push the set parts of the omelette into the <br>uncooked centre of the omelette. Cook again, until the omelette has set further, then push <br> those set parts into the centre of the omelette again. Repeat the process until the eggs <br> have just set but the omelette is still soft in the centre. </li>
            <li>Put the cheese and 3/4 of the ham in the centre of the omelette, cook until the cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to high and cook the omelette for a further 30 seconds, <br> or until it browns on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Fold the omelette in half, then remove the pan from the heat and tilt it slightly to move the <br> omelette to the edge of the pan. Slide the omelette onto a serving plate, then shape it into a <br> neat roll. Sprinkle over the remaining ham. </li>
