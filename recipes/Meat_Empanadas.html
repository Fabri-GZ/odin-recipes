        <h2> Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li style="margin: 10px;">In a pot with hot oil add the onion and the bell pepper. Let brown for a few minutes and when <br>they are half cooked (transparent onion), add the garlic and a little salt and pepper.</li>
                <li style="margin: 10px;">Raise the heat and add all the minced meat at once. Move the meat so it doesn't stick. <br>When the meat is sealed, add the diced tomato and the 2 tablespoons of tomato puree.<br> Season with paprika and cumin, a little more salt and pepper and mix well. <br> Cover (not completely, leave a small hole) and cook for half an hour, stirring little by little.</li>
                <li style="margin: 10px;">Remove from the heat and let cool in the pot. Add the chopped olives and mix well. <br> (In this step you can add anything else you want: hard-boiled egg, raisins, potatoes, etc.)</li>
                <li style="margin: 10px;">Distribute the filling in the empanada covers, and close with a traditional repulgue. <br> Before putting them in the oven you can paint them with egg, but it is optional.</li>
                <li style="margin: 10px;">Put our meat empanadas on a plate and bake in a strong oven until golden brown and enjoy!</li>
